## Usage

The app collects the data about orders and processes them on BE side to provide you with the analysis of users preferences and choices. As a BE solution, I used Firebase. I wrote a custom cloud function to generate the report.

Besides that, the app is pretty useless - but was a playground to implement core and crucial features like use of native device camera, location or full authentication flow.

## Installation

To start the project:

1. run:

```bash
     npm install
```

2. fill out env.default.js with your API data, and rename the file to env.js

3. run:

```bash
     npm start
```
